# SPEC_UAT_TRACK_STATUS

## Snapshot

- Role: Graphify WP-UAT-TRACK background status report.
- Source of truth: `track`, workspace `graphify-conductor`.
- Local HEAD after conductor fast-forward: `1a11b68` (`Merge pull request #114 from rhanka/feat/track-f-0819m-dotnet`).
- Strict conductor result: no WP is accepted-DONE at this HEAD under `track report --commit HEAD --decisions --require-accepted`.
- Track changed during this audit from `92` to `107` events; this report reflects the final rerun after those concurrent conductor/subagent events landed.
- Graph freshness: `.graphify/branch.json` reports `stale:false`; no `.graphify/needs_update` was present during this check. Final local code changes were followed by `npx graphify hook-rebuild`: `5639` nodes, `10882` edges, `245` communities.
- Public UAT direction: the public demo route is `/graphify/studio/`; `.graphify/graph.html` is legacy/local, not the public route.

## Track Board

Final `track report --commit HEAD --decisions --require-accepted` returned:

- `AWAITED`: WP8 (`realization=done`, `acceptance=unknown`).
- `DONE`: none under the require-accepted gate.
- `TO-DO`: WP0..WP7. WP0 is `done/stale`; WP2 and WP3 are `done/unknown`; all three are therefore excluded from strict DONE.

Without `--require-accepted`, track places WP0, WP2 and WP3 in `DONE`; WP1, WP4, WP5, WP6 and WP7 in `TO-DO`; WP8 remains `AWAITED`.

| WP | Declared % | Track state | Strict done? | Done / evidence | To do / expected |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WP0 Conductor integration baseline | 100 | `done` / `stale` | No | Local branch is now fast-forwarded to remote `main` `1a11b68`; latest observed remote CI and Pages were green at that SHA. | Attach final local gate evidence after this conductor commit, then decide whether WP0 can be accepted or remains a baseline row only. |
| WP1 Renderer GraphCanvas rich parity | 90 | `in-progress` / `unknown` | No | `claude:graphify_subagent` reported SG1 merged as PR #113: zoom/pan/reset, connected-dim selection+hover, node tooltip, tests green. Local duplicate renderer edits were intentionally not reapplied. | Final visual UAT and remaining P2/P3 items: keyboard a11y and deeper WebGL GPU parity beyond Canvas2D. |
| WP2 Design-system header compliance | 80 | `done` / `unknown` | No | Header patch restored on top of `1a11b68`; evidence links `studio/src/tests/appHeader.test.js`. Local targeted and full Studio tests pass after fast-forward. | Final desktop/mobile visual UAT and DS audit findings outside the header if they become acceptance criteria. |
| WP3 Graph storage backends | 85 | `done` / `unknown` | No | `claude:graphify_subagent` reported PR #112 merged: `graphify export spanner` DDL/DML artifacts. Dirac added `SPEC_GRAPH_STORAGE_BACKENDS.md` as decision matrix/risk register, not replacement for `SPEC_STORAGE_BACKENDS.md`. | Open decisions remain: PR5 `graphify store` CLI surface, Neo4j replace strategy, Spanner live-adapter scope, SQLite priority. |
| WP4 ACLP-AM ontology hierarchy lifecycle | 45 | `in-progress` / `unknown` | No | ACLP-AM G1+G2 first iteration confirmed; G4 layout pins continue in parallel. | Finish product spec, output schemas, implementation, ACLP-AM UAT and double review before merge. |
| WP5 Track F upstream parity residuals | 80 | `in-progress` / `unknown` | No | `claude:graphify_subagent` reported PR #114 merged: F-0819-M .NET project-file extractor plus paired XML billion-laughs guard. | Next delegated lot: F-0820-0827 outside #996; keep #996 blocked/tracked separately. |
| WP6 Public UAT and mysterypack publication | 60 | `in-progress` / `unknown` | No | Public `/graphify/studio/` returns HTTP 200 and uses relative `./assets/...`; public `/graphify/graph.html` returns 404. | Confirm final domain/mysterypack state and run a real visual smoke on the final URL. |
| WP7 Agent coordination h2a and subagents | 65 | `in-progress` / `unknown` | No | `claude:graphify_subagent` replied on `claude:graphify:17bddf135979`; conductor acknowledged: graphify_subagent owns ontology logic/artefacts/reconciliation, ACLP-AM is reviewer/interface partner, Codex conductor owns shell/UI and gates. | Keep owners, blockers, expected deliverables and liveness current in track; avoid duplicate ACLP-AM workers. |
| WP8 Harness migration out of superpowers rituals | 10 | `done` / `unknown`, `AWAITED` | No | Realization transitioned to done during this audit. Evidence now links `spec/SPEC_CONDUCTOR_HARNESS.md`, with a local pass run recorded as `manual runbook review + track --help validation`. | Resolve the still-awaited/deferred harness direction and set conductor acceptance only after confirming the runbook fully maps track/h2a/verification gates and resume without status loss. |

## Delegation Status

Delegation is effective in track, but not accepted:

- Decision `Delegate graphify WPs by default and keep conductor on integration gates` is `go`.
- Wave 1: WP1 to `codex:codex-graph-lib:84a7f37d306b`; WP2/WP3/WP5 to `claude:graphify:17bddf135979`; WP4 ACLP-AM coordination to `claude:graphify:17bddf135979`; recipients were recorded as not live at deposit time.
- Wave 2: Codex subagents spawned for WP2 Header DS, WP6 Public UAT/mysterypack, WP8 Harness runbook, and WP1 parity tests. A graphify_subagent mandate was also deposited for SG1 renderer P0, SG2 ACLP-AM G1/G2/G4, SG3 storage backends, and SG4 Track F/release residuals.
- Correction recorded during this audit: one `claude:graphify_subagent` workstream only; ACLP-AM is reviewer/interface partner rather than concurrent worker. A mistakenly spawned local ACLP-AM Codex subagent was shut down before deliverable.
- `claude:graphify_subagent` wave2 report received: SG1 renderer PR #113, SG3 storage PR #112, SG4 Track F PR #114 merged; SG2 ontology is read-only so far and awaits incremental ownership confirmation. Conductor sent confirmation for graphify_subagent to own ontology logic/artefacts/reconciliation and take F-0820-0827 outside #996 next.
- Current liveness check: repo `.h2a` returned `[]`; shared h2a returned live `codex:graphify:f64a071db3a8` and `codex:graphify:a30c53dd2294`; `h2a subagents` is not a supported command in this CLI; tmux required elevated read access and confirmed `remote-graphify:0.0 /home/antoinefa/src/graphify node`.

## Blockers And Risks

- WP8 is the only `AWAITED` row. It now has a `done` realization, but remains `acceptance=unknown` and awaited because the harness direction/acceptance has not been closed.
- WP0 is stale, not accepted. Local HEAD is now `1a11b68`, but do not mark WP0 accepted until final conductor commit/CI/pages/graph freshness evidence is recorded.
- WP2 and WP3 have `done` realization with evidence/runs, but no conductor `acceptance=pass`; they should be treated as claimed-done pending review.
- Dirty worktree after fast-forward contains conductor docs/header/track changes only; local renderer duplicates were left in the stash and not reapplied. Source integration gates were rerun locally; CI/pages evidence still has to be attached after the conductor commit if strict track acceptance is required.
- Public `/studio/` is reachable, but the remaining WP6 acceptance is a visual smoke on the final URL plus mysterypack/page synchronization. HTTP 200 alone is not enough.

## Harness Requirements To Keep

- Start every conductor resume with `git status`, current HEAD, `track report --commit HEAD --decisions --require-accepted`, graph freshness, h2a/tmux inventory and CI state.
- Treat `track` as authority; specs, h2a messages, tmux panes, CI and chat are evidence until linked or reflected in track.
- Count DONE only when `realization=done` and `acceptance=pass`, unless the user explicitly waives acceptance.
- For product changes, conductor acceptance must include scope review, diff review, local verification, CI, track acceptance and graph freshness after code changes.
- Public UAT should keep targeting `https://rhanka.github.io/graphify/studio/`; `graph.html` remains a local standalone legacy export.
