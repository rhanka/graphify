/**
 * Provenance of a CONVERTED document: original PDF -> converted markdown -> citation.
 *
 * A PDF corpus never reaches the extractor as PDF: `src/pdf-ocr.ts` converts each
 * paper into `.graphify/converted/pdf/<stem>.md` and the pipeline extracts (and
 * cites) THAT markdown. So every citation's `source_file` points at the
 * conversion output, and the document the user actually owns — the PDF, with its
 * pagination, figures and layout — is nowhere in the citation record. A reader
 * asked to "open the source" gets an OCR transcript instead of the paper.
 *
 * The original path is not lost, though: the converter records it in up to three
 * carriers next to (or inside) the markdown. This module reads them back and
 * turns the pair into an explicit, serializable chain so a downstream viewer can
 * offer the ORIGINAL document. Two deliberate properties:
 *
 *   - Recording the chain and BUNDLING the originals are separate decisions.
 *     A provenance map for a whole corpus is a few thousand short strings; the
 *     originals behind it can be tens of gigabytes. The map is therefore always
 *     cheap enough to emit, and the copy stays opt-in
 *     (`--include-original-sources`).
 *   - Nothing here is allowed to fail an export. Every carrier is best-effort:
 *     a missing, truncated or hand-edited sidecar yields `null`, never a throw.
 *     Provenance is an enrichment; losing it must never cost the bundle.
