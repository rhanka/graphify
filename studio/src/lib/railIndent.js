/**
 * ADAPTIVE rail indentation — the per-level step SHRINKS with depth.
 *
 * The left rail is narrow (~306px) and, now that the registry forests are
 * spliced INTO the ontology tree, a row can sit 7+ levels deep
 * (`Process → ABP → DE → DE.AI → DE.AI.01 → …`). A CONSTANT indent step is the
 * wrong shape for that: whatever value keeps level 1 legible either wastes the
 * rail at level 1 or eats the whole width by level 6, and the deepest rows lose
 * their label and their trailing badges to the rail's x-clip.
 *
 * So the step is a function of the row's OWN rendered depth, with two guarantees:
 *
 *   1. GEOMETRIC DECAY — `step(d) = BASE · DECAY^d`, floored at `MIN`. Each level
 *      costs less than the one above it, so the first levels stay clearly
 *      readable as structure while deep levels cost almost nothing.
 *   2. A HARD TOTAL BUDGET — the cumulative indent never exceeds `BUDGET`. Once
 *      the budget is spent the step is 0: an arbitrarily deep tree can never
 *      push a row's label + badges out of the rail.
 *
 * With the defaults the budget is reached asymptotically rather than abruptly
 * (Σ BASE·DECAY^d = BASE/(1−DECAY) ≈ 2.5rem < BUDGET), so the clamp is a safety
 * net for pathological depths rather than a visible cliff.
 *
 * Generic by construction: the scheme is driven by `depth` alone — no repo, no
 * artifact, no ABP/ACLP knowledge. Every consumer (ontology class rows and
 * registry-forest rows alike) shares ONE ladder, so a forest row nested under two
 * class levels continues the same decay instead of restarting it.
